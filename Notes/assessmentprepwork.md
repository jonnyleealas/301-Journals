Strengths

Adaptability- I like learning new ways of doing things. Going with the flow of things. I’ve seen people panic with the unexpected. I’ve panicked in those circumstances as well. However, one day it hit me. Instead of going crazy why not take a moment and think things through. Why not take a breath and look for a different path? Adaptability helps me find something good in any situation.

Ambition and Initiative- Growing up I didn’t have ambition or initiative. But, I’ve learned If you’re not ambitious life will pass you bye. If you don’t take initiative what could be yours will go to someone else. I’ve missed out on a few things in life because of lacking ambition and initiative. I am not that person anymore. Today could honestly be anyone’s last day.  Ambition and initiative pushed me to sign up for this bootcamp. 

Constant Improvement- People are always shocked when they hear where I’ve come from and who I was. I always tell them, “I learned from books and youtube”! I was afraid to talk to crowds so I started buying books on how to do so. Later I started performing on stage, and forced myself to make eye contact with the crowd. I kept notes on what I did right or wrong. Each show I would try something new. Also, I wasn’t confident in myself so I took Jiu Jitsu classes to build confidence and mental strength. Growing up I didn’t have many people around me to learn from so one day I decided to learn on my own. This is probably my biggest strength. Everyday I look for one small thing I can do to be better.

Weakness

Curiosity- I am a curious person, however; my weakness is asking questions. I always think I can figure it on my own. I know I’m wrong,but it is a weakness of mine. Also, I am still learning how to organize things in terms of priority. What I should do now, and what I can do after. I know it’s a weakness of mine, and I’ve been working for years to fix it, but I haven’t gotten it down yet. 

Inclusivity- I have noticed in the few classes that I’ve taken with code fellows that I mostly keep to myself. I need to change that. I need to be part of the group more and help people be part of the group. I haven’t done that. Zoom is new to me so that can be part of the problem. However, I do have a tendency to be quiet at first. Being this way may lead people to think I don’t value them or don’t want to work alongside them. That’s not good. I’m working on it. 

Ambiguity- Sometimes I get hung up on learning everything about a thing before moving forward. I must have all the info. However, stack learning has shown me that full understanding isn’t always needed to move forward. Maybe moving forward without all the info isn’t so bad. Maybe it can lead to creative solutions. This is definitely an area I can improve on, but I’m excited to learn.
