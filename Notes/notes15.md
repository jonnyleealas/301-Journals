Brian Nations: he quit his job. he as asked to be mentored 12 hours a day coding. Listening. Terrified and cruying. This is not for me I am not a programmer. Persist till someone fires you. He just kept going and going. he was givne an opportuinty to get some work through his mentor. He had a talk with a look of fear. He was given a full time offer fulltime. He looked embarrassed when offerred 25k. His family was giving him doubt. His goal was to persist till someone fired him. A year after he was able to understand ecommerce and front end javascript. Afte two years he finally started going into getElement.byid.
After 2 years he decided to move on to a bigger company. Blue acorn. He applied and was given an offer greater than double his first salary. 3 to 6 months someone would tap him on th shoulders and getting 3k more 3k more 3k more. He taught the class that he once took. Withing the first class he taught everythign change. He made a pivot to become a software developer instructor. He applied ad codefellows. He moved from charleston. Hes been here for 5 years. He loves teaching. He cannot get over the addiction of seeing people struggle of people while they are at cf and 5 months later they get a 90k offer from amazon. he sees it over and over and over again. think about my background and use it as a path forward and torards success as a developer. The core elememnt that has helped ihm is not having a tech background. Take the lelements of your past and use them to leverage them towards your career. Me being me is wholeistec approach to  software develpmetn. Showcase those skill sets by using your background. 

We need to see this as a sofware develoing team that has deliverables and deadlines due in a weke. Work with the team. understand eachothers weakness and strengths. Give kind and caring feedback.
I may be in a team where i am the weakest or strongest and I still contribute. Figure out how I can conrobite. Teams can be similar or different. Honesty and itregrety to push from point at to point b. I need to take on task a littlel bit ourside of my reach. I need to be ok at anywhere in the bucket. Find my strengths. I should at least take on a small js task to jump out of my box. It will hepl me grow. 

radical candor. challengeing personaly and professionaly. Can you walk me through this feature. tonality and the way of saying things. Figure out the best tones to use when talking to people. face to face setting. get ready to work long hard hours. we should be exshuasted by the end of next week. care about the project. we need to live in this throughout the next week. everysingle day as much as I can. we need to be so in the thick of it. We should work 16 hour days in code school. we will get more out of it if we emurse ourselves in it.
