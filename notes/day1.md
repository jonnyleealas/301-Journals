we write more code than 4 year colleges. I can learn anything really really fast because I am jused to learning that way in 
code fellows. I have to write my own code. That code is not mine if I take it from someone else. Self awareness and self regulation. Motivation. And social skills. All equal emotional intelligence. code fellows is a certification. Unconcious bias means I dont know that I am bias about something. Drawn to people more like me as opposed to people less like me. 
I've learned to pace my learning. Not to overload my brain and stress. Take it in small incremints and give my mind time to rebuild after small learning
sessions.

## array in local storage
array goes in to local. and local sends back into a new array. same array just new because its getting remade. This will affect the const.
- const cannot be changes like var.
- const can be changed inside of an array; rather the things inside of an array can be changes.
- const changing inside of an object is allowed.
- a const is like a city. people can move in and out of seattle but seattle remains seattle. the city/ const cannot change.
- const cannot be used in a loop because loops change i every time they loop.
