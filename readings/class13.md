## Client Server
Client makes a request to a server using HTTP protocol. Server will answer using HTTP. 
- Apache
- Nginx 
- IIS
- Tomcat
HTML is the form we use to configure HTTP request to the server.Information is delivered in this way to the HTTP request

## Form
This defines how data is sent. All attributes are designed for requests to be sent when the submit button is used. 
## Action
This is where the data is sent. Or where the data is going to. It's value is a relative or an absolute URL. If it doesn't have an attribute everything goes to the page that contains the form.

- Get method asks the browser to ask the server to send a resource. 
- Post uses data and asks the browser to look at the data and send back a result.
