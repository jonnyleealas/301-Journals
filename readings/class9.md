## Functional programming
- Style and elements of programming.

### Pure functions
- Returns the same result if given the same arguments.
- No side effects.
- Returns same results with the same given arguments.

### Impure functions.
- If it doesn't return the same result it is an impure function.
- If it reads external files it is not pure.
- Random number generation is also impure.

### Immutability
- Unchanging over time.
- Cannot change after it is created.

### Higher-order functions
- Takes functions as arguments.
- Returns function as it's result.

### Filter
Expects a true or false value to determin if the element should or should not be included. If call back is true it will include the element. If false the element will not be included.

### Imperative approach
- Empty array > iterate over numbers > push into empty array.

### Map 
- Applies a function to all it's elements.
- Builds a new collection from return.
### Reduce
- Returns a value by combining items.
- Takes functions.
