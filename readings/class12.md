# EJS Partials
Partials allow us to reuse layouts in html in multiple pages. If we wanted to use the same html layout features through out different pages we would use EJS partials as a template. 
# 
For partials we have to us < % >. Inside we include the name of the file for the template we are making. Anytime we want to use partials we can use the open and close signs with the file name inside. Basically any time a reusable texts becomes static we should use partials. However, the important thing to remember is to set the correct file path.
