## Diversity 
70% of employees in tech were male in 2014. So basically, things are pretty lopsided. At some point the percentages of male to female tech graduates were leveled, but things have gone down since the 80s. It could be marketing or maybe that the way that companies hire is due to gender bias. 
# 
Some believe that the way things were marketed may be the reason why female graduates have lowered since the 80s. Many video games and tech related advertising was aimed at males.There was actually a handheld gaming system called the 'Game Boy'. Side note, I am still salty that I was never able to own a game boy lol. 
# 
Another reason why women are less likely to go into tech is that some have said that it feels isolated. It makes sense I think. I was once interested in becoming a nurse, but opted out partly because it is a female led career. I was concerned if people would accept me as a nurse being a dude lol. So in that perspective I guess it makes sense that some women would feel isolated going into a career that seems to be male dominated.

I am hopeful things can change moving forward. Also, I feel that some things are moving towards a better place. I recently passed by a skatepark and noticed that the girls to boys ration was almost 40-60%. I remember growing up and there would be 0 girls skateboarding. I also see that there are many women fighters in the ufc. A few years ago there were 0. If I can notice these changes in sports then maybe similar changes can somehow trickle over to tech.
