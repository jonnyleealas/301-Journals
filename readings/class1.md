### Floats
Floated elements remain a part of the flow a a web page. Floats lets the words wrap around the element on a page.
Floats are useful in smaller areas of a page.
- Clearing a float is used to clear the float from a desired element.

Floats create alternate flows. 
- normal, left, and right.
The floated element takes up left or right and the elements that don't have the float are left to flow with the the spaces left by the floated elements.
