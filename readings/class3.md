## JS templating Mustache
Mustache is a templating library for js. It is simple and less complex. We can use it in js and jquery.
We can also use a cdn to use mustache.js. We add the cdn tag in the script section underneath jquery.
We can put in data from a data file using mustache.js.

## Flexbox CSS
An easier way to display items in a column or row. 
- we use display: flex 
- Justify content displays things evenly.
- We can use flex-direction to position elements in a horizontal row.
- We can set the flex property of an individual item as percentages in order to display them evenly.
- Everything inside of a flex container becomes a child that we are now able to adjust.


### Justify-content
- flex-end positions items to the right of the screen
- center aligns items in the center top of the page.
- align- items: center brings items from the top center to the lower center of the screen.
- space between adds space evenly in between.
- space around adds space in the begining and in between.
